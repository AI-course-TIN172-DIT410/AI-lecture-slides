# AI lecture slides

Presentation slides for a course in Artificial Intelligence, based on
Poole & Mackworth (2010) *Artificial Intelligence*: <http://artint.info/>

The slides are written in LyX (http://www.lyx.org). Apart from LyX you
will need LaTeX, and possibly some non-standard LaTeX packages too.
